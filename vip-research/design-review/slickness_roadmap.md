# Slickness Roadmap

## Current quality gate status

The automated review loop passed at weighted score 100 with no open critical or high gaps.

## Priority one polish

1. Add subtle motion standardization for cards and drawers with one shared transition duration token.
2. Introduce one shared icon sizing scale for compact, regular, and emphasis actions.
3. Tighten copy rhythm in card subtitles and metadata rows for faster scan.

## Priority two polish

1. Harmonize page level section spacing so route transitions feel more consistent.
2. Add empty state illustration style that uses Factify neutral and brand accents only.
3. Normalize table row hover behavior between dashboard and analytics views.

## Priority three polish

1. Add optional reduced motion mode for animation heavy interactions.
2. Add stronger semantic status legends for complex dashboards.
3. Add visual density toggle for power users on data heavy screens.

## Suggested next execution loop

Run one targeted loop on desktop only for high traffic routes:

1. `/vips`
2. `/vips/vip-1`
3. `/documents`
4. `/viewer/doc-1`

Then run one full viewport loop before release.
